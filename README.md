## ▶️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repositry
https://github.com/ShaktiCodes/Object-detect.git

cd Object-detect.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see it in action.

## 📷 How It Works

1. Loads the pre-trained COCO-SSD model using TensorFlow.js.
2. Captures live video frames or analyzes uploaded images.
3. Runs object detection and overlays prediction boxes and labels.
4. Continuously updates predictions in real-time (if webcam is used).
